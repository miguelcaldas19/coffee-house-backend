# coffee-house-backend

For this application I used MySql database and tomcat application server (dependencies in pom.xml)
By default, I created the "manager" and "employee" roles and some categories to make the application easier to use.

# Settings for connection to database 

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_HOST:localhost}:3306/stockmanagement
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=12345
